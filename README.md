msc-seminar
===========

The presentation for the seminar I had to give for my Master's degree.

Improved Arithmetic in the Ideal Class Group of Imaginary Quadratic Number Fields with an Application to Integer Factoring.

This is similar to the defense presentation, only this is more detailed and estimated to be 45 minutes long instead of 15 minutes long.  Although, I actually prepared it the day before presenting, so who knows how long it actually will take.
